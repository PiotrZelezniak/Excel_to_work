# Excel_to_work
So this is a code I created wchich is gonna to help me in my current job. I'm working in 3D printing and i have to write in excel every single thing i print. So thats a lot. Thats is why i decided to automatize it
My code works like that:
I create new .txt file where i copy filename of file wchich i was printing. Then my program is started working. 
It changes this .txt file into .csv file. 
Then there is work with date. Sorting+adding some new date. 
Later the basic Excel is created and then there is some operation on Excel like adding colours to specific cells or changing width of the cells. It is saved as new excel but it doesnt have to. In futere it will overwrite the first Excel. 
In future im gonna add automatic taking date'Wycena' from this website https://3dream.pl/wycena/ but i dont know how to do this yet.
