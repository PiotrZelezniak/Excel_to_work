# Excel_to_work
So this is a code I created wchich is gonna to help me in my current job. I'm working in 3D printing and i have to write in excel every single thing i print. So thats a lot. That is why i decided to automatize it
My code works like that:
I create new .txt file where i copy filename of file wchich i was printing. Then my program is started working. 
It changes this .txt file into .csv file. 
Then there is work with data. Sorting+adding some new data. 
Later the basic Excel is created and then there is some operation on Excel like adding colours to specific cells or changing width of the cells. It is saved as new excel.
